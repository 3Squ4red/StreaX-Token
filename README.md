# StreaX (STRX)
Minimalistic and sleek website for an ERC-20 token on Goerli testnet

## Tokenomics ðŸ’µ
- Max supply of StreaX will never exceed 100,000,000
- There's no monetary value of a StreaX token i.e. it's free
- The person to deploy this contract will be considered the `creator` of StreaX And he will also get 70% of the total supply of StreaX as a reward i.e. 70,000,000 StreaX(s)
- One StreaX can be divided into 18 smaller values
- The miner/validator who includes a transaction of this contract will also receive some StreaX(s) as *block reward*, which can be updated by the creator whenever he wants. The `blockReward` is initially set to 50 tokens
- The creator will also have the option to 'destroy' the StreaX contract
  - Doing this will remove all the STRX tokens from existence
